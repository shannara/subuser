Common coding tasks
===================

Adding a new permission
-----------------------

To add a new permission, you first need to get the new permisison accepted into `the subuser standard <https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser-standard>`_ via pull request.

Once it is accepted:

 1. Set the permission's default value, description, and level in the `permissions module <https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser/blob/master/logic/subuserlib/permissions.py>`_

 2. Tell subuser how to apply the permission in the `runtime class <https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser/blob/master/logic/subuserlib/classes/subuserSubmodules/run/runtime.py>`_

Running the test suit
---------------------

In the root source directory run::

    subuser dev texttest

Building the docs
-----------------

In order to build the docs, you must have the subuser-standard within the docs directory.  In order to get the subser-standard issue::

    git clone https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser-standard.git

To build the docs, cd to this repositories root, run ``subuser dev docs`` and run ``make html`` in the docs directory::

    cd ..
    subuser dev docs
    cd docs
    make html

Profiling
---------

Running a built in command, with the exception of ``test``, with the ``SUBUSER_RUN_PROFILER`` environment variable set will run those commands and print profiler output once the command has finnished.

Debugging the XPRA bridge
-------------------------

If you set the ``SUBUSER_DEBUG_XPRA`` environment variable then XPRA logs will be left in ``~/.subuser/volumes/xpra/<subuser-name>/xpra-home/``. XPRA will also spew out a bunch of garbage to the screen that you can read through.
