Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --accept              When testing images, accept permissions without
                        asking.
  --prompt              Prompt before installing new images.
  --image-sources-dir=IMAGESOURCESDIR
                        When initializing a new repository, set where the
                        image source directories will be stored. This may be
                        set when you are working with an existing git
                        repository which you would like to unobtrusively add
                        subuser image sources too.
  --permissions-file=PERMISSIONSFILE
                        When adding a new image source, the path to the new
                        permissions.json file for the image source. Note: This
                        flag should not be used to import permissions files
                        from outside of the repository. Use the POSIX cp
                        command for that.
  --image-file=IMAGEFILE
                        When adding a new image source, the path to the new
                        image file which will be used to build the image
                        source. Note: This flag should not be used to import
                        build files from outside of the repository. Use the
                        POSIX cp command for that.
  --build-context=BUILDCONTEXT
                        When adding a new image source, the path to the build
                        context for building the image.
