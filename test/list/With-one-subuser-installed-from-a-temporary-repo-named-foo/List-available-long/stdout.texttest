 Moderate permissions(These are probably safe):
  - user-dirs: To access to the following user directories: '~/Downloads'
  - sound-card: To access to your soundcard, can play sounds/record sound.
 Liberal permissions(These may pose a security risk):
  - x11: To display X11 windows and interact with your X11 server directly(log keypresses, read over your shoulder, steal your passwords, control your computer ect.)
  - system-dirs: To read and write to the host's `/var/log` directory, mounted in the container as:`/var/log`
 WARNING: These permissions give the subuser full access to your system when run.
  - privileged: To have full access to your system.  To even do things as root outside of its container.
